Wikipedia has specific guidelines and requirements for creating a page for a person, place, or business. The primary criterion is notability, which means the subject must have received significant coverage in reliable secondary sources that are independent of the subject. For a person, this might include news articles, books, or academic papers. For a business, it could involve extensive media coverage, historical significance, or notable achievements within its industry. Places generally need to have historical, cultural, or geographical significance to create a page.

The number of years a business must be operational before it qualifies for a Wikipedia page is not fixed. Instead, the focus is on the business's impact and recognition in its field. A startup might become notable within a few years due to rapid growth or groundbreaking innovations, while other businesses might take decades to achieve the necessary recognition. The key is the availability of independent, reliable sources that document the business's significance.

### Accumulating Terrorism and Mass Shootings

![Shooter](https://github.com/sourceduty/Wikipedia/assets/123030236/19494cb0-8def-4cd6-b1db-c0cd7589ef90)

Wikipedia includes lists and locations of terrorism due to the encyclopedic nature of the platform, which aims to provide comprehensive information on a wide range of topics, including those of significant public interest and concern. Documenting terrorist incidents, organizations, and related activities serves to inform the public, provide historical context, and support research and education. These entries are typically well-sourced from credible publications, ensuring that the information presented is accurate and reliable. The inclusion of such content reflects Wikipedia's commitment to covering notable and impactful events, even when they are controversial or sensitive in nature.

Recording and publicly displaying terrorism records can have a paradoxical effect. On one hand, documenting acts of terrorism is crucial for historical accuracy, public awareness, and policy-making. It helps to inform the public about the severity and impact of such acts, fosters understanding of the patterns and motivations behind terrorism, and can aid in preventing future incidents. However, the extensive media coverage and detailed documentation of terrorism can also inadvertently contribute to further acts. This phenomenon, often referred to as the "media contagion effect," suggests that the publicity surrounding terrorist acts can inspire copycat behavior. Terrorist organizations may exploit this coverage to gain notoriety, spread their ideology, and recruit new members. The detailed reporting on methodologies and outcomes can provide a blueprint for future attacks, as potential terrorists seek to emulate or surpass previous incidents.

Similarly, the recording and public display of mass shootings can have both informative and detrimental effects. Comprehensive documentation of these tragedies is essential for understanding the scope of gun violence, identifying risk factors, and developing preventative measures. Public awareness can drive legislative changes and community initiatives aimed at reducing the occurrence of such events. Nevertheless, extensive media coverage of mass shootings can also contribute to the phenomenon known as the "copycat effect." This effect suggests that the high visibility of mass shootings can influence individuals who are already on the edge, providing them with a script to follow and a way to achieve notoriety. The detailed coverage of the shooters' backgrounds, motives, and the consequences of their actions can inadvertently glamorize the act in the eyes of potential perpetrators, encouraging them to carry out similar attacks.

In both cases, the challenge lies in balancing the need for public information and the responsibility to prevent the unintended promotion of violence. Media outlets and public platforms must navigate this delicate balance by reporting on terrorism and mass shootings responsibly, focusing on the impact and responses rather than sensationalizing the perpetrators.

The conceptual table of shooting-related death machines presents a variety of lethal devices, each offering different point values based on their level of difficulty or sophistication. Automated turrets and sniper bots, common in many shootings, provide significant challenges and award high points, ranging from 130 to 140. More powerful weapons like the rocket launcher and homing missile system, which deal massive damage and are harder to evade, offer the highest point rewards at 160 and 180, respectively. On the lower end, simpler traps such as poison dart traps and flare guns yield fewer points, reflecting their limited lethality or ease of avoidance, with awards ranging from 105 to 115 points.

Weapons that combine precision and power, like railguns and laser cannons, sit near the top of the points scale, rewarding players with 165 to 170 points for kills, highlighting their destructive potential. Unique weapons such as electric dart guns or tranquilizer guns add a layer of complexity, offering strategy but slightly lower rewards in the 90 to 145-point range. The variety of shooting death machines in the table reflects a balance of lethality, skill requirement, and strategic importance, making each option viable depending on the shooter's tactical needs or the challenge level they wish to face.
